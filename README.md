rfutils

These are some various chunks of python that I've found useful to keep
around. Many of them are useful, while some of them are just doodles 
that I haven't had a chance to use much yet. Some might be split off
into their own modules if they keep growing.

Stuff I use all the time:
* binarysearch
* entropy
* filehandling
* indices
* memoize
* myitertools
* myrandom
* systemcall
* nl/isling

Optimized stuff:
* editdist
* listop

Doodles:
* manytoone
* myiter
* ondiskiter
* onetomany
* probcounter
